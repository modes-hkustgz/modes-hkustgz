Car-following behavior data in autonomous driving scenarios(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14995837). This dataset contains processed longitudinal car-following behavior data derived from the Waymo Open Dataset, specifically focusing on autonomous vehicle (AV) operations in stable traffic scenarios. The data captures interactions between leading vehicles (LVs) and following AVs (FAVs) to analyze stochastic car-following distances and speed regulation patterns.
