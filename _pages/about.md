Led by Dr. Xiaotong Sun, the Lab of Mobility Optimization and DEcision Science (MODES) at HKUST (Guangzhou) focuses on the **planning, operation, and regulation** of multi-modal transportation systems empowered by emerging technologies. Drawing on analytical optimization, game theory, and data-driven approaches, MODES advances research through a **dual lens**: modeling to understand how complex transportation systems operate, and optimizing to enhance their performance.
