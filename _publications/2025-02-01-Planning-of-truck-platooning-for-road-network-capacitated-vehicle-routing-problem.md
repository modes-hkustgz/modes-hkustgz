excerpt: "This study pioneers the integration of truck platooning into capacitated vehicle routing problems with time windows (CVRPTW) by developing a road network-based optimization framework and a three-stage algorithm to minimize total costs—including dispatch and energy expenses—while serving multi-customer demands, with numerical experiments validating the model’s efficacy and quantifying platooning’s cost-saving potential in real-world logistics operations."
