excerpt: "This study examines the impact of delivery-driven curb parking demands on urban curb dynamics through continuum modeling and comparative statics, revealing that optimized metered parking pricing for general users outperforms dedicated delivery bays and duration caps, with demand source-dependent strategies and adaptive bay sizing proving critical to curb management efficiency, thereby challenging the necessity of delivery-specific infrastructure under optimal pricing."
