excerpt: "This study analyzes the distinct charging demand patterns of electric ride-hailing vehicles using trip data from 96,716 Shanghai-based vehicles, employs spatial regression models to reveal significant correlations between charging needs and built environment variables, and integrates supply-side data to evaluate public charging infrastructure sufficiency, uncovering spatiotemporal demand variations and spatial lag effects."
