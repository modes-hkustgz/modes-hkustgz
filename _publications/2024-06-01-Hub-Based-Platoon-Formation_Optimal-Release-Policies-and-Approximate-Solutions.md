excerpt: "This study optimizes truck platoon formation at highway hubs under decentralized, distributed, and centralized policies by developing dynamic programming-driven release thresholds and receding horizon solutions, revealing that decentralized strategies—despite yielding ~3.5% and 8% lower rewards than distributed and centralized approaches—achieve near-optimal performance without inter-hub coordination, validated via simulations on Swedish highway hubs."
